                Just a few things about me...
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hobbies:  I like to hike, throw darts, ride my bicycle and motorcycle, and just recently - throw axes!
            </p>
            <p>
                Unique Things:  I'm an Army Brat and a Veteran.  I've completed a full Ironman Triathlon (2.4 mile swim, 112 miles on a bike, and a full 26.2 marathon for a total of 140.6 miles).  I'm a member of Mensa (High IQ Society).  I'm a father of 4, grandfather of 2 (1 on the way).  I ran the program that I earned my first degree from (AAS Computer Networking) - 4 years after graduation I replaced my instructor as the Professor over that program.  I did a 1 year contract in Afghanistan on the most attacked FOB in 2012 - it was nicknamed "Rocket City".  I self-studied for the CISSP for 1 month and passed the first time.

                Cool Work Things:  I've mentioned a couple of cool things that I've done, here are a few more.  I ran Waffle Houses for a long time before working on their Point-of-Sale systems.  My first security job was on an operations team where I was exposed to everything from disaster recovery to reviewing IDS logs for suspicious activity.  My last security job had over a million live IPs that I ran vulnerability management on, which included 20K PCI IPs.
